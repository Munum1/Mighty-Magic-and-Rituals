WARNING UNDERDEVELOPMENT



Still dont know in what direction to take the mod, very barebones with only basic items lootables and recipes.

Current version adds items: 

Chisel.
Ruby.
Raw Ruby .

Food Items:

Garlic (If eaten raw will give the nousea affect)
Garlic Bread (Gives saturation effect if lucky.)
(Plans for future crops of the same time and also diffent types).

Current Blocks:

Ruby Block
Raw Ruby Block
Ruby Ore/Deepslate Ore
Magic Alter (A very basic version with only 2 test recipes).

Note: 

All textures are done by me and are all early versions or placeholders will be updated and streamlined in later updates.

In the future new ores and items and a magic system will also be implement with crops and tress coming as well.



I will post updates in the changelogs and update on development as it progresses.
